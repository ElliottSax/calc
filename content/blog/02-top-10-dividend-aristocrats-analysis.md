## Tax Implications of Aristocrats

### Preferential Tax Treatment

Most Dividend Aristocrats pay qualified dividends, taxed at preferential rates:

- **0% bracket:** Income <$46,000 (single)
- **15% bracket:** Income $46,000-$518,900 (single)
- **20% bracket:** Income >$518,900 (single)

Versus ordinary income rates (10%-37%), Aristocrats typically save investors 15-25% in taxes.

**Positioning Aristocrats:**
- Qualified dividends in taxable accounts (good)
- REITs (like Realty Income) in 401k/IRA accounts (better)

Holding Aristocrats for 1+ years creates long-term capital gains treatment:

- Holdings <1 year: Taxed as ordinary income
- Holdings >1 year: Taxed at preferential long-term rates (0%, 15%, 20%)

**Implication:** DRIP investors naturally benefit because holding periods exceed 1 year.
